# Fridge Scrabble App
An unofficial companion Android app for the magnetic fridge Scrabble game

# Instructions
This game came with no official instructions, so this is how I play:

1. Click "New Game" button upon opening the app. This will set the correct letter counts for each letter
2. Click "Get Letters". This will select 7 random letters from the remaining letters available.
3. Play as many letters as possible in the turn (all letters are "use it or lose it")
4. Score the letters played, and next player goes.
5. Continue until no letters are left or you decide game is over

This app is unaffiliated and not devleoped with or by Scrabble, Hasbro, or Wild and Wolf
